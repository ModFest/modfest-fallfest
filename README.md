**ModFest: FallFest** was a mod development jam that ran from October 1st through October 15th, 2020.

This modpack contains all submissions, as well as a showcase world built by participants to show off their mods!

**Key Features**:
- Witness the dawn of 33 mods, including **Phonos**, **Collectator**, and **Ars Theurgica**!
- Explore a dark spooky archipelago, with mod "booths" in mansions, caves, and mini-islands!
- Duck between trees and temples under cover of the night - and to your favourite tune!
- Find up to 88 collectable "taters" scattered around the map!
- Hop between each of the booths via the floating mod hub!
- Be spooked to your bones!
